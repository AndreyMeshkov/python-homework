# Data Types
# Instructions
# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
#
# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
#
# Example Input
# 39
# Example Output
# 3 + 9 = 12
#
# 12
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

#
# Hint
# Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
# Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
# Think about type conversion.

num = input('Enter  the number: \n')
print(int(num[0]) + int(num[1]))

# Coach's solution:

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#
# ####################################
# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#
# #Check the data type of two_digit_number
# print(type(two_digit_number))
#
# #Get the first and second digits using subscripting then convert string to int.
# first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
# second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])
#
# #Add the two digits togeter
# two_digit_number = first_digit + second_digit
#
# print(two_digit_number)
